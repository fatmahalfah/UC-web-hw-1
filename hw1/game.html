        It is an online multiplayer game and a game that was released on March 23, 2017, and is available on Windows, Xbox One and Play 4 devices.
        Up to 100 players each aiming to be the last survivor.  Players can choose between servers where the player is alone and not in a particular team, or servers that allow two or four people to participate in the team.  In all cases, the last person or team surviving wins the match.
 At the beginning of each match, players parachute out of a plane onto an island without any items in their possession.  Once they land, players can search buildings and other locations to find weapons, vehicles, and other equipment, which are randomly distributed throughout the map at the start of the match
